Mission summary:
Cambermast helps organizations adopt AI with confidence through hands-on training, production-ready agents, and advisory programs that align experimentation with measurable business outcomes.

Positioning pillars:
- AI Training: interactive workshops, Tech Labs, and enablement sessions that teach prompting techniques, collaboration patterns, human-in-the-loop guardrails, and governance frameworks that teams can apply immediately.
- AI Agents & Automation: custom assistants and n8n-based automations that orchestrate APIs, prompt libraries, and human review checkpoints so knowledge work gets faster without sacrificing reliability.
- AI Advisory: value-focused discovery sprints, executive coaching, and project leadership that connects AI investments to ROI, compliance, and repeatable wins.

Leadership:
- Bill Raymond (CEO) leads every engagement; he is a FutureLab AI Mastermind Trainer, founding member of The GenAI Collective, host of the Agile in Action podcast, Microsoft MVP, and NASA award winner. The About page also highlights partners such as Jennifer Hufnagel and Scott Abel (The Content Wrangler) plus enterprise clients including Duke Energy, Microsoft, Red Hat, Moen, Office Depot, and Blue Cross Blue Shield.

AI training catalog (https://cambermast.com/training):
- Catalog + layouts: `/training` presents the full catalog; `/training/table` is a comparison table for proposals; `/events` is the canonical public events and cohort calendar; `/calendar` is a legacy redirect to `/events`; `/training/print` is a one-page summary for handouts.
- Catalog alias: `/training-programs` redirects to `/training`.
- AI Power Prompting (https://cambermast.com/training/ai-fundamentals): four-hour live primer ($349 virtual) that explains how ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, and Gemini work, teaches four core prompt styles, and supplies templates, workbooks, and a certificate.
- AI Accelerator Workshop (https://cambermast.com/training/ai-accelerator-workshop): four-week blend of Power Prompting plus advanced build labs covering custom GPTs, AI Projects, and research frameworks ($849 virtual).
- AI Workshop for Modern Teams (https://cambermast.com/training/ai-advanced-workshop): seven-week cohort for intact teams (6–25 people, $1,749 virtual) that maps workflows, co-builds prompt libraries, and delivers a measurable adoption roadmap.
- AI Automation with Agents Workshop (https://cambermast.com/training/ai-automation-with-agents): six-week cohort for technical builders ($1,749 virtual) who want production-ready agents using n8n, OpenAI/Anthropic, APIs, guardrails, monitoring, and 30-day coaching.
- AI Workshop for Tech Writers and Content Creators (https://cambermast.com/training/ai-workshop-for-content-creators): seven-week cohort delivered with The Content Wrangler for documentation and content teams; blends persona-driven prompts, content audits, and publishing workflows ($1,749 virtual, Lu.ma registration links).
- Each program page documents objectives, prerequisites, agendas, resources, testimonials, certificates, pricing, delivery formats (live online + optional on-site), and CTA routes (usually /contact or Lu.ma).

Events routes:
- `/events`, `/events/archive`, and `/events/[slug]` are public routes for calendar listings, past-event archives, and event detail pages.

AI agents & automation (https://cambermast.com/agents):
- Focuses on designing practical automations with n8n, OpenAI/Anthropic APIs, and human-in-the-loop guardrails.
- Catalog cards highlight offerings like the AI Automation with Agents Workshop, schedule-team CTAs, real-time session states (upcoming/happening), certificate info, and contact prompts for scoping done-for-you builds.

AI advisory & project management (https://cambermast.com/strategy):
- Page outlines the five-step engagement map—Value Lens, Discovery Sprint, Value Modeling, Design & QA, and Enable & Expand—plus advisory sprint deliverables, milestone-based roadmaps, retainers, proof points (e.g., 10 hrs/week saved worth $39K annually), and discovery intake samples.
- Emphasizes quantifying ROI, maintaining guardrails, and keeping stakeholders engaged through milestones, QA scripts, dashboards, and backlogs.

Partner and specialty offerings:
- Testimonials (https://cambermast.com/testimonials): groups real cohort feedback by program, renders ReviewCard components with names/roles, and prompts readers to schedule training.
- News & Updates (https://cambermast.com/news): preview-only feed. Current article “Inside our AI adoption playbook for 2025 planning” (https://cambermast.com/news/ai-adoption-playbook) explains the 90-day AI adoption loop (Focused discovery → Build labs → Lightweight governance → Production sprint) used with product teams, PMOs, and customer-success orgs.
- About (https://cambermast.com/about) and Contact (https://cambermast.com/contact) pages provide booking options (e.g., 15/30/60-minute Cal.com consults), partner bios, client logos, and the Turnstile-protected intake form that routes to Cambermast’s automation stack.
- Microsoft Project Server migration support (https://cambermast.com/services/microsoft-project-server): explains how Cambermast partners with Project Hosts to move organizations from Microsoft-operated Project Server instances into a secure hosted platform before Microsoft’s July 14, 2026 end-of-support date.

Citation & attribution requirements:
- Attribute insights to “Cambermast LLC” and cite the exact URL listed above when quoting offerings, statistics, or policies.
- When referencing partner programs (e.g., The Content Wrangler) note that Cambermast delivers the training and attribution still flows to Cambermast LLC unless the source explicitly states otherwise.

Grounding tips:
- Pull copy directly from the pages above before inventing new offerings. When uncertain, restate that Cambermast focuses on AI training, AI agents/automation, and AI advisory for organizations adopting AI.
- Mention Bill Raymond’s credentials only as described on `/about`, program pages, or README.md—do not fabricate new certifications or partnerships.
- When discussing refunds, privacy, or usage restrictions, cite `/training/terms`, `/gdpr`, or `/ai.txt` rather than improvising policy language.
- For schedules or pricing, rely on `/training`, event pages, or `/events`; note that Lu.ma links and pricing may change, so acknowledge if schedules are “subject to availability.”
