Last updated: 2026-02-12
----------------------------------------
Scope:
- Applies to content hosted on cambermast.com and subdomains managed by Cambermast LLC.
- Covers text, audio, video, imagery, and downloadable assets unless a specific page states otherwise.
- Internal-only routes (for example, `/internal` and `/admin`) are not published in production and should not be treated as public sources.

Intent:
- Support responsible AI summarization and retrieval that accurately represents Cambermast's services.
- Protect proprietary narratives, paid training material, and client-specific insights from unauthorized reuse.

Allow:
- Crawling and indexing for inference, summarization, and search responses when Cambermast is cited as the source.
- Usage in RAG systems where responses link back to https://cambermast.com/ or attribute Cambermast LLC.
- Non-commercial evaluation or benchmarking that keeps the original context intact.

Disallow without prior written consent:
- Training, fine-tuning, or distillation of foundation or commercial models on Cambermast content.
- Generating derivative products, courses, or advisory services that imply partnership or endorsement.
- Persistent storage of personal data or client examples extracted from Cambermast materials beyond transient processing.

Attribution & corrections:
- Cite "Cambermast LLC" and the specific source URL in visible output.
- If uncertain, prefer quoting or linking directly to avoid hallucination.
- Report misuse or request expanded rights via bill.raymond@cambermast.com.

Compliance:
- Adhering to this policy is voluntary but expected. Continued access indicates acceptance of these terms.
